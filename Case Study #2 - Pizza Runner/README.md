## 📝 Problem Statement
Danny has launched Pizza Runner, a startup that combines pizza delivery with an Uber style runner network. Customers place orders through a mobile app, and freelance runners deliver pizzas from Pizza Runner Headquarters.

The app records order, delivery, and recipe data, but the information is messy with null values, inconsistent formats, and unstructured ingredient lists. To help Danny grow his Pizza Empire, the data needs to be cleaned, transformed, and analyzed with SQL to uncover insights about customer demand, runner performance, and business profitability.
