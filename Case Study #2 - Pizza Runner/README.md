# Case Study #2 - Pizza Runner

## üìö Table of Contents
All information regarding the case study can be found [here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-2/).

## üìù Problem Statement
Danny has launched Pizza Runner, a startup that combines pizza delivery with an Uber style runner network. Customers place orders through a mobile app, and freelance runners deliver pizzas from Pizza Runner Headquarters.

The app records order, delivery, and recipe data, but the information is messy with null values, inconsistent formats, and unstructured ingredient lists. To help Danny grow his Pizza Empire, the data needs to be cleaned, transformed, and analyzed with SQL to uncover insights about customer demand, runner performance, and business profitability.

## üßπ Data Cleaning

### Table: customer_orders

When reviewing the `customer_orders` table, we can see that some columns contain inconsistent values:  
- The `exclusions` and `extras` columns are inconsistent, containing a mix of `NULL` and blank (`''`) values.
<br>

| order_id | customer_id | pizza_id | exclusions | extras | order_time          |
| -------- | ----------- | -------- | ---------- | ------ | ------------------- |
| 1        | 101         | 1        |            |        | 2020-01-01 18:05:02 |

<br>

**üõ†Ô∏è Cleanup Strategy**

- Clean the `exclusions` and `extras` columns to ensure consistent handling of missing values.  
- Replace empty strings `''` or the literal string `'null'` with SQL `NULL`.  
- Store the cleaned results in a new temporary table `customer_orders_clean`. 
<br>

```sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE customer_orders_clean AS
SELECT 
  order_id, 
  customer_id, 
  pizza_id, 
  CASE
	  WHEN exclusions = '' OR exclusions = 'null' THEN NULL
	  ELSE exclusions
	  END AS exclusions,
  CASE
	  WHEN extras = '' OR extras = 'null' THEN NULL
	  ELSE extras
	  END AS extras,
	order_time
FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders;

SELECT * FROM customer_orders_clean;
```

<br>
The query above produces the following cleaned version of the `customer_orders` table:

&nbsp;

| order_id | customer_id | pizza_id | exclusions | extras |    order_time     |

### Table: runner_orders

When reviewing the `runner_orders` table, we can see inconsistent values across multiple columns:

- Some columns contain the literal string `'null'` or blanks (`''`)
- Numeric fields like `distance` and `duration` also include text units (`'km'`, `'minutes'`, `'mins'`, etc.).  
- The `cancellation` column mixes blanks, `'null'`, and valid text values.
<br>

| order_id | runner_id | pickup_time         | distance | duration   | cancellation            |
| -------- | --------- | ------------------- | -------- | ---------- | ----------------------- |
| 1        | 1         | 2020-01-01 18:15:34 | 20km     | 32 minutes |                         |
| 2        | 1         | 2020-01-01 19:10:54 | 20km     | 27 minutes |                         |
| 3        | 1         | 2020-01-03 00:12:37 | 13.4km   | 20 mins    |                         |
| 4        | 2         | 2020-01-04 13:53:03 | 23.4     | 40         |                         |
| 5        | 3         | 2020-01-08 21:10:57 | 10       | 15         |                         |
| 6        | 3         | null                | null     | null       | Restaurant Cancellation |
| 7        | 2         | 2020-01-08 21:30:45 | 25km     | 25mins     | null                    |
| 8        | 2         | 2020-01-10 00:15:02 | 23.4 km  | 15 minute  | null                    |
| 9        | 2         | null                | null     | null       | Customer Cancellation   |
| 10       | 1         | 2020-01-11 18:50:20 | 10km     | 10minutes  | null                    |
<br>

**üõ†Ô∏è Cleanup Strategy**

- Standardize the `pickup_time`, `distance`, `duration`, and `cancellation` columns to remove inconsistent values.  
- Convert the literal string `'null'` or empty strings `''` into SQL `NULL`.  
- Remove text units from numeric fields:  
  - Remove `'km'` from `distance`.  
  - Remove `'mins'`, `'minute'`, or `'minutes'` from `duration`.  
- Store the cleaned results in a new temporary table `runner_orders_clean`.  
<br>

```sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE runner_orders_clean AS
SELECT 
  order_id, 
  runner_id,  
  CASE
	  WHEN pickup_time LIKE 'null' THEN NULL
	  ELSE pickup_time
	  END AS pickup_time,
  CASE
	  WHEN distance LIKE 'null' THEN NULL
	  WHEN distance LIKE '%km' THEN TRIM('km' from distance)
	  ELSE distance 
    END AS distance,
  CASE
	  WHEN duration LIKE 'null' THEN NULL
	  WHEN duration LIKE '%mins' THEN TRIM('mins' from duration)
	  WHEN duration LIKE '%minute' THEN TRIM('minute' from duration)
	  WHEN duration LIKE '%minutes' THEN TRIM('minutes' from duration)
	  ELSE duration
	  END AS duration,
  CASE
	  WHEN cancellation = '' OR cancellation = 'null' THEN NULL
	  ELSE cancellation
	  END AS cancellation
FROM pizza_runner.runner_orders;

SELECT * FROM runner_orders_clean;
```
<br>

Alter the `pickup_time`, `distance`, and `duration` columns to the correct data type.

<br>

```sql
ALTER TABLE runner_orders_clean
	ALTER COLUMN pickup_time TYPE TIMESTAMP USING pickup_time::timestamp,
	ALTER COLUMN distance TYPE FLOAT USING distance::float,
    ALTER COLUMN duration TYPE INT USING duration::int;
```

<br>

The queries above produce the following cleaned version of the `runner_orders` table:

&nbsp;

| order_id | runner_id |     pickup_time     | distance | duration |      cancellation      |
|----------|-----------|---------------------|----------|----------|------------------------|
|    1     |     1     | 2020-01-01 18:15:34 |   20     |    32    | NULL                   |
|    2     |     1     | 2020-01-01 19:10:54 |   20     |    27    | NULL                   |
|    3     |     1     | 2020-01-03 00:12:37 |  13.4    |    20    | NULL                   |
|    4     |     2     | 2020-01-04 13:53:03 |  23.4    |    40    | NULL                   |
|    5     |     3     | 2020-01-08 21:10:57 |   10     |    15    | NULL                   |
|    6     |     3     | NULL                |  NULL    |   NULL   | Restaurant Cancellation|
