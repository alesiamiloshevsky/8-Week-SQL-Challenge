## ‚ùì Case Study Questions
**1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**
```sql
SELECT 
  sales.customer_id, 
  SUM(menu.price) AS total_sales
FROM dannys_diner.sales
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu
  ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY sales.customer_id
ORDER BY sales.customer_id;
```

**Steps**
- Use `JOIN` to merge `dannys_diner.sales` and `dannys_diner.menu` tables so both `sales.customer_id` and `menu.price` are available.  
- Use `SUM` to calculate the total sales for each customer.  
- Group the results by `sales.customer_id`.  
- Order the output by `sales.customer_id` in ascending order.

**Answer:**
| customer_id | total_sales |
|-------------|-------------|
| A           | 76          |
| B           | 74          |
| C           | 36          |

**2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**
```sql
SELECT 
	customer_id, 
	COUNT(DISTINCT order_date) AS count_visits
FROM dannys_diner.sales
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id;
```

**Steps**
- Select `customer_id` from the `sales` table.  
- Use `COUNT(DISTINCT order_date)` to count unique visit days for each customer.  
- Group the results by `customer_id` so each customer‚Äôs total visits are calculated.  

**Answer:**
| customer_id | count_visits|
|-------------|-------------|
| A           | 4           |
| B           | 6           |
| C           | 2           |

**3. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**
```sql
WITH first_visit AS 
(
SELECT 
	customer_id, 
    order_date,
  	product_name,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date) AS rank_number
FROM dannys_diner.sales s
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu m
	on s.product_id = m.product_id
)

SELECT 
	DISTINCT customer_id, 
    product_name
FROM first_visit
WHERE rank_number = 1
ORDER BY customer_id, product_name;
```

**Steps**
- Create a CTE `first_visit` joining `dannys_diner.sales` with `dannys_diner.menu` to bring in `product_name`.
- Use `DENSE_RANK()` with `PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date` to identify each customer‚Äôs first purchase day.
- Filter to `rank_number = 1` to keep only rows from the first day per customer.
- Select `DISTINCT customer_id, product_name` so duplicate items from the same day aren‚Äôt repeated.

**Answer:**
| customer_id | product_name |
|-------------|--------------|
| A           | curry        |
| A           | sushi        |
| B           | curry        |
| C           | ramen        |
