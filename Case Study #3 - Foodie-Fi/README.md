All information regarding the case study can be found [here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-3/).

## üìù Problem Statement
Foodie-Fi is a streaming service with monthly and annual plans that gives customers unlimited access to exclusive cooking videos from around the world. Danny and his team want to use this data to see how customers move from trial to paid, which plans they choose, when they switch plans, and when they cancel.

## Case Study Questions

### A. Customer Journey

<br>

Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customer‚Äôs onboarding journey.

<br>

```sql
SELECT 
	subscriptions.customer_id,
    plans.plan_id,
    plans.plan_name,
    plans.price, 
    subscriptions.start_date
FROM foodie_fi.plans plans
INNER JOIN foodie_fi.subscriptions subscriptions
	on plans.plan_id = subscriptions.plan_id
WHERE subscriptions.customer_id IN (1, 2, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19)
ORDER BY customer_id, plan_id;
```
<br>

I joined the `subscriptions` and `plans` tables to include plan names and prices for each subscription, making the results clearer and easier to summarize.
