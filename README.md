# 8-Week-SQL-Challenge
This repository contains my solutions for the 8 case studies from the [8 Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/) by Danny Ma. All datasets and problem statements are credited to the original author.

It highlights my ability to work through real-world SQL scenarios, showcasing skills in query writing, optimization, and problem-solving. Each case study includes the problem statement, my SQL solutions, and explanations of the approach I took.

A special thanks to Data With Danny for designing these case studies! 👋🏻
